## Comprehend Medical Samples

Sample code to start using Amazon Comprehend with C# and Dotnet Core Console
application. This sample uses test files in png and jpg formats that are read by
Amazon Textract for text detection. The detected text is then passed to Amazon
Comprehend that detects Entities and PHI. The detected Entities and PHI are then
printed on screen.

# Amazon Comprehend Medical Samples for .NET Core

.NET Core Samples for
[Amazon Comprehend Medical](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/). Amazon
Comprehend Medical is a natural language processing service that makes it easy
to use machine learning to extract relevant medical information from
unstructured text. Using Amazon Comprehend Medical, you can quickly and
accurately gather information, such as medical condition, medication, dosage,
strength, and frequency from a variety of sources like doctorsâ€™ notes, clinical
trial reports, and patient health records.

This sample uses a two step process:

- It uses [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) AWS .NET SDK to
  detect text from a PNG file (sample.png) located in test-files/ folder. You
  can use your own PNG or JPG file. Amazon Textract can also read from PDF but
  that is out of scope for this sample, and
- Amazon Comprehend Medical AWS .NET SDK is then used to analyze the detected
  text to detect entities like attributes, categories, and traits, and detect
  PHI information
